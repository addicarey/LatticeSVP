Lattice-based Cryptography: A Python Approach to the Shortest Vector Problem

Lattice-based cryptography relies on complex mathematical problems, notably the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), which involves finding the shortest non-zero vector in a lattice. Understanding and visualizing the SVP is crucial for grasping the security foundations of these cryptographic systems. 

My project aims to develop Python-based visualizations to illustrate the SVP, enhancing the comprehension of lattice structures and the inherent challenges in solving the SVP, demonstrating the strength and complexity of lattice-based cryptography. 

Throughout my project, I have used various different experimental methods. I researched the mathematical foundations of lattices and the idea of the SVP including existing algorithms and their computational complexities. I developed a real implementation of these algorithms that approximate solutions to the SVP. Additionally, I created interactive visualizations to depict lattice structures and the process of identifying shorter vectors within these lattices. Lastly, I assessed the efficiency and accuracy of the implemented algorithms across various lattice configurations. 

I started my project in February 2025, and have researched and gained insights to understanding the fundamentals of lattice structures and the SVP. I have explored existing resources to comprehend the mathematical intricacies of SVP. I have attempted to simulate basic lattice formations and apply simple vector operations using Python. Additionally, I have reviewed current visualization techniques to identify effective methods to representing high-dimensional lattice data.
